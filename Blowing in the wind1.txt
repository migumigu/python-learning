Blowin' in the wind
How many roads must a man walk down - Bob Dylan
Before they call him a man - Bob Dylan
How many seas must a white dove sail - Bob Dylan
Before she sleeps in the sand - Bob Dylan
How many times must the cannon balls fly - Bob Dylan
Before they're forever banned - Bob Dylan
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind - Bob Dylan
The answer is blowing in the wind - Bob Dylan
